note about displaying content from array... forEach preffered.. vs map.

it's worth noting that using map for its side effect (logging) is not a common use case and may be considered unconventional. It's generally recommended to use forEach when you want to perform an action on each element in an array without creating a new array, as it communicates your intent more clearly.
